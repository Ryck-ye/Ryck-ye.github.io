### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    In this lab, we worked with arguments for one of the first time I believe. I found I like working with them because it meant using the program much easier to use and much more efficient. I think what made this lab so good was my partner, excellent partner, and good communication: I can say I made a friend. In real life, I also love playing blackjack. 

* Lab 8

    Why I like part 8, is completely different from why I liked the other two labs. In lab part-1 we used comp sci/code to art in some way or at least something close to it. Anyways I loved it because that is something I would like to do in the future use computer science and express creativity to make new and unique things. 

* Lab 11

    As of writing this, we did not finish the lab, but we did finish part 1. Not sure if this was one of my favorite labs, but I was so happy when are endless efforts of part 1 succeeded after the 2 hours ended. After the code was put together it looked so much easier than it felt but it was a huge pressure relieved.
